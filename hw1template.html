<h4>Honor statement:</h4>
<p>I have not cheated in any way when doing this assignment, I did it on my own. I may have asked questions about the assignment on Piazza, I know that’s totally fine and even encouraged. I also already know that this class is graded on a curve. I realize that if I cheat and by some miracle not get caught, any increase in my grade will in turn shift the curve and result in lower grades for my classmates. Any undeserved extra grade would come at the cost of all others. That’s horrible! I would never do it.</p>

<p> In the spatial domain we can see aliasing happen in the form of wave like 
    patterns on both leaves in the high frequency picture. You can see them in the middle 
    right side of the picture and around the center of both leaves.
    In the frequency domain if we compare it to the frequency representation 
    of the original photo we can see that the center of the image is darker 
    and now there are more high frequency components toward the edges of the 
    frequency representation.
    Another thing to note is that I tried ailising with many high frequency photos and most 
    of them didn't show affects of aliasing in the half the size subsampling.
    As for the lower frequency picture we can see that the picture looks completely fine even 
    though it has a lower quality now. in the frequency domain of it we can see that more high 
    frequency components are visible than the original one but no aliasing is visible.

<p> Here in the quarter the size subsample we can clearly see the effects of 
    aliasing in the high frequency image. In the spatial domain there are 
    spiral and wave like patterns all around the picture on the leaves. And 
    in the frequency domain we can see that it looks completely different and 
    very noisy. It has bright points all arounf in no apparent order.
    As for the lower frequency image similar to last part even though it has 
    a lower quality now, it still has no aliasing effects. And in the frequency
    domain of it it also has more bright points all around the representation.

<p> If we look at the half version image with ani-aliasing we can see no aliasing 
    effects and even tho the image is less sharp than the original it is not blurry. 
    For ani-aliasing the half version I used Gaussian kernel with <b>size: 3</b> and 
    <b>standrard deviation: 1</b> as it was sufficient to remove aliasing without 
    making the image too blurry. Also looking at the frequency domain representation
    we can see that the top right and bottom letf of it are less bright but the Gaussian 
    kernel used was not large enough to see the effects of it clearly in the frequency 
    representaion as we did in part 3.
    If we look at the quarter version image the anti-alia has removed all the aliasing
    but it has also made the image quite blurry. for the quarter version I used Gaussian 
    kernel with <b>size: 13</b> and <b>standrard deviation: 3.75</b>. I used these values 
    because even setting the standard deciation to 3.5 or any smaller size still showed 
    aliasing on the top right corner of the picture.

<h4>5: Canny edge detection thresholding</h4>

<img src="assets/HP-canny-highhigh.png" alt=" HP-canny-highhigh" width="300" height="300">
<p>I chose <b>low threshhold of 0.05</b> and <b>high threshhold of 0.13</b> as my optimal threshhold.
    The high frequency image has many edges and in the low-low representation the picture is all edges, 
    it has no depth in the picture and the outer edges are blended in with the inner edges. The high-low 
    representation is very close to my optimal but I still preferred to ahow more of the inner edges 
    (look at the top left leaf it has more inner edges in the optimal one). The low-high and high-high 
    representations are missing many edges.
    This is still not perfect because when you try to lower the threshhold to view darker edges (towards
    the center of the leaves then it will also pick up things that are not edges or of less importance).

<p>The lower frequency image has a lot of different shapes which made choosing an optimal pair of threshholds
    quite interesting. I chose <b>low threshhold of 0.02</b> and <b>high threshhold of 0.17</b> as my optimal threshhold.
    The low-low representaion has picked up many things that are not edges. The high-low representation is very 
    close to my optimal but has more details from the back grounds which was not desirable. The low high has missed 
    many edges that I cared about like the left sholder and nose. and the high-high has too little edges.
    This is very close to perfect for me but I would have still liked to see smother edges on the left sholder and less 
    edges picked up from the background.
